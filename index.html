        <p>Coffee is one of my favorite drinks below water, I usually have 2-3 cups in the morning and no more. I am currently taking an Intro to Neuroscience elective and did the AP CSP exam in freshman year. I am in no cluds, but thinking about joining the robotics team. I have a small passion for graphic desing and video editing, though procrastination is one of my biggest weaknesses.</p>
